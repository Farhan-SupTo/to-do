# React + TypeScript Project with Bun and Vite

This project is a modern React application built with TypeScript. The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast builds and development and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for managing dependencies and streamlining build processes.

## Features

- ⚛️ React: Component-based UI development.
- 🦾 TypeScript: Type safety for better code quality.
- ⚡ Vite: Lightning-fast development and build tool.
- 🥯 Bun: Fast package manager and runtime.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using Bun:

```bash
```
bun install

### 3. Start the Development Server

Start the development server to preview your project locally:

```bash
bun dev
```

### 4. Build for Production

Generate the production-ready files with optimized assets. This command will output the built files into the `dist/` directory:

```bash
bun build

```
### 5. Preview the Production Build

Run a local server to preview the production build. This command serves the optimized build files from the `dist/` directory:

```bash
bun preview
```
